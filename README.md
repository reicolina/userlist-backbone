# userlist-backbone
Experimenting with the idea of using backbone for building an app from a scratch. This is a prototype app to explore the benefits of using backbone.js when building a new application from a scratch.

This app is a basic user list that lets you perform searches, create new users and assign a user to a group.

Core functionality that will be evaluated:

* Filtering
* Data binding
* Routing
* cross-browser compatibility (back to IE8)
